SmartGit 17.0.2 (2017-02-09)
============================
New Features, Improvements
--------------------------
- Git:

    to avoid out-of-memory errors

Fixed Bugs
----------
- Git:
  - Log:
    - GitHub: possible endless refreshing
- GitHub: updated default fingerprint
- GitHub, other hosting providers: do not warn for changed fingerprint if it's a
  known, new fingerprint 
- undone "automatically set java.net.useSystemProxies=true (if not set) to
  improve auto-detection of proxies" because it causes to always use the system
  proxy, even if "no proxy" was configured in SmartGit
- GUI (Windows): sort column was too dark in default bright theme


SmartGit 17.0.1 (2017-01-27)
============================

=============================
New Features, Improvements

  scroll the undone change into view
